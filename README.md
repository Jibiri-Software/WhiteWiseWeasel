# We are White Wise Weasel!!!!!!!!!!!!!

#### 1. Description

Our project is oriented to develop a solution to protect users from malicious advertisements. Our solution will be implemented as  a webpage. The main idea is to protect our users from frauds, hoaxes and any kind of misleading warning.

Users will be the ones to provide feedback to the app, using a system of points. Users will report content, and the rest will vote it positively or negatively. Although the proccess will be somewhat automatic, there should always be a human part to decide whether a polemic element has been made by malicious individuals or not. For this, we will have moderators that will decide if the reported content should be considered a hoax/scam or not. A reported scam will be waiting for verification until a moderator revised it and change it status to “verified” or “denied”.

Users will have a “trust factor” that will be based on the efficiency rate of each user, raising with each verified hoax, and reduced by every mistake, the higher the trust factor, the more their reports counts. Users should  give reasons and sources about why a post is thought to be fake, increasing the validity of its report. A system of acknowledgements and achievements could be included to motivate them to stay active. Maybe with help of sponsors, or even giveaways.

We could also count the resources some companies spent in storage and analyzing of spam and hoaxes. 


#### 2.- Viability analysis

The project would have an slow beginning, due to the lack of a great number of mods and admins, but it will become more efficient eventually.

In general, it doesn’t require economic risks and we have the material resources needed to carry out the project. The main threat in our case would be human resources. Being honest, the team is not really experimented on Software development and moreover, we count with a strict deadline (6th of june). The main and decisive factor would be an excellent planning and strategy in order to assign human resources efficiently. Making any kind of mistake would mean not completing the project. That’s why it is fundamental to make sure that the idea is consistent.

With a good reward system, it would be viable to create a great group of people that state that a content is a hoax in any website or social network.

The creation of the database wouldn’t also be a problem. It will include the elements based on users content and, by a manual supervision, it is possible to delete those contents that shouldn’t be on the database.


#### 3.- Requirements

Our project must provide a data structure to store things without classification, another one for the ones classified as a hoax and the ones that are not.

It will need to have an user friendly interface so our users can report, or vote on the veracity of unclassified hoaxes.

Having categories for the lists of hoaxes, so the users can be aware of what they need the most (to-do for a future edition).


#### 4.- Planning

We discussed the differents ways of developing a project and reached the conclusion that a spiral process would be the best approach to develop this project. Time is our major enemy so in case we couldn’t finish the project we would have some part done. With a non incremental model, we risk all or nothing, which would damage the viability of the project.

After a second meeting we have decided to approach the project with a spiral development process. We think this model fits better with our view of the project and allow us to fix the mistakes as soon as they appear.

The first element of the project will be the database, as most actions will need it to work.
Then we can begin to think about tools like the verification system, that would have a simple GUI at first which we can make evolve over time.
